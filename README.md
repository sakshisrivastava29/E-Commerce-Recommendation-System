# E-Commerce-Recommendation-System

Building an E-Commerce Recommendation System with Flask and Machine Learning.
Started by collecting and preprocessing the e-commerce dataset, including product attributes, user ratings, and interactions. Next, implemented content-based recommendation algorithms to suggest products based on their features and user preferences. Then developed collaborative filtering models using techniques like matrix factorization and neighborhood-based methods to predict user-item interactions. To enhance recommendation accuracy and coverage, created hybrid models that combine content-based and collaborative filtering approaches. Explore multi-model recommendation strategies, integrating multiple machine learning models to provide diverse recommendations. Throughout the development process, utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.

Integrating with Flask and E-Commerce Website:

After building the recommendation system, integrated it with a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface. The Flask application will include features such as user registration, product browsing, search functionality, and recommendation display.Leveraged Flask's routing capabilities to handle user requests and render dynamic web pages with personalized recommendations. Furthermore, implemented user authentication and session management to ensure a secure and seamless browsing experience. The e-commerce website will feature product cards displaying essential information, including images, descriptions, prices, and ratings. Users will have the option to interact with the recommendation system by providing feedback, such as ratings and likes, to improve future recommendations.
